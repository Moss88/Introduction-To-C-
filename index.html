<a id="Intro" class="anchor" href="#intro" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Introduction to C++</h3>

<p>The following content has been generated overtime through teaching a introductory college level C++ course. The materials assume that you have had no previous experience in programming C++, or any other language. Because of this the lessons will teach the absolute basics such as variable declaration, and printing to the console all the way up to object orientated programming and data structures such as linked list. The programming exercises assume bare C++ 11 code, which means all programs are console based instead of graphical user interfaces.</p>


<p>The material is structured as three parts: lecture slides, guided exercises, and individual exercises. The lecture notes will introduce a topic and explain how and why to use the new topic. Several exercises will be shown for the topic, and the solutions will be given. Finally, exercise questions will be shown given which can be completed to gain proficiency in the given topic.</p>

<a id="GettingStarted" class="anchor" href="#gettingStarted" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting Started</h3>

<p>At a minimal you will need a C++ developement enviroment to write and compile your code. This series makes no assumptions as to the operating system you are running or the C++ compiler you are using. While there are many good integrated development environments that can be used, including visual studio, eclipse CDT, code::blocks, and NetBeans, I would personally recommend QT Creator. QT Creator is a free, commercially supported cross platform IDE. It is easy to install, easy to use, and most importantly is very stable.

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>Everyone is invited to contribute or modify the materials uploaded to this website. The lecture series stops short of being a complete overview of C++. For instance, OOP topics such as inheritance and polymorphism should be added, as well as C++11 topics such as smart pointers should be incorperated. I encourage contribution to complete the materials.</p>
<p>I do ask that when showing code examples, try to minimize the complexity of the code to make it more understandable. This includes writing less efficent code to make the exercise more understandable.</p>
